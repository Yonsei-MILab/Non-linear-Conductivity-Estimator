# Example File

As an example training and test datasets, numerical simulations were performed in MATLAB for cylindrical phantoms: 2D-complex B1+ & B1- maps were obtained by the Bessel-boundary-matching method, which enables electromagnetic field simulations for concentric models.
Both single & Double-layered cylindrical models were composed with various radiuses and various conductivity values, resulting in a total of 58 example cylinder models for the training dataset.
